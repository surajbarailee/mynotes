            Domain Name Server
          </h2>
          <p>
            The Domain Name System is a hierarchical and decentralized naming
            system for computers, services, or other resources connected to the
            Internet or a private network. It associates various information
            with domain names assigned to each of the participating entities.
          </p>
          <p><strong>Working Procedures of DNS:</strong></p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              When your computer need to connect with a host on the Internet
              (e.g. MyGreatName.com), you only need to enter the Domain Name
              (e.g. MyGreatName.com) in the URL of browser. Your computer will
              then contact the configured or default Name Servers (usually your
              ISP Name Server), asking for the IP Address of the host (e.g
              MyGreatName.com).
            </li>
            <li>
              If your ISP Name Server has the information of the IP Address of
              the query host, it will tell your computer immediately.
            </li>
            <li>
              Assume that your ISP Name Server do not have the information of
              MyGreatName.com. Your ISP Name Server will ask the DNS Root Name
              Server immediately the Name Server that has the information of
              MyGreatName.com.<br />
              Actually all Name Servers will download and install a file from
              the FTP server of interNIC. The file is called "named.cache" or
              "named.root". This file has the IP Addresses of ALL Root Name
              Servers. <br />
              Root Name Servers have all of information of Autoritative Domain
              Name Servers for the top level domain names (for example: .com,
              .org, .net, .com.hk, etc ..)&nbsp;
            </li>
            <li>
              When your ISP Name Server do not have the IP address information
              of MyGreatName.com, it will check the named.cache file and ask for
              help from the Root NameServer. If the first Root Name Server is
              out of order or do not have response, your ISP Name Server will
              ask the second Root Name server.
            </li>
            <li>
              Root Name Server will then tell your ISP Name Server the
              authoritative Name Server of MyGreatName.com are 212.69.192.10
              (Primary Name Server) and 212.69.192.11 (Secondary Name
              Server).&nbsp;
            </li>
            <li>
              Your ISP Name Server now has the IP Address of the Authoritative
              Name Server of MyGreatName.com. Your ISP Name Server will then
              contact the Authoritative Name Server of MyGreatName.com
              (212.69.192.10). The Authoritative Name Server of MyGreatName.com
              will then check and confirm the information of MyGreatName.com. It
              then tell the IP Address of MyGreatName.com (212.69.204.148) to
              your ISP.
            </li>
            <li>
              Your ISP Name Server now has the IP Address of MyGreatName.com, it
              will tell your computer immediately.
            </li>
            <li>
              Once your computer get the IP Address of MyGreatName.com, your
              computer can then communicate with MyGreatName.com.
            </li>
          </ol>

          <h2>DNS Types: 3 DNS Query Types</h2>
          <p>There are three types of queries in the DNS system:</p>
          <h3>Recursive Query</h3>
          <p>
            In a recursive query, a DNS client provides a hostname, and the DNS
            Resolver &ldquo;must&rdquo; provide an answer&mdash;it responds with
            either a relevant resource record, or an error message if it can't
            be found. The resolver starts a recursive query process, starting
            from the DNS Root Server, until it finds the Authoritative Name
            Server (for more on Authoritative Name Servers see DNS Server Types
            below) that holds the IP address and other information for the
            requested hostname.
          </p>
          <h3>Iterative Query</h3>
          <p>
            In an iterative query, a DNS client provides a hostname, and the DNS
            Resolver returns the best answer it can. If the DNS resolver has the
            relevant DNS records in its cache, it returns them. If not, it
            refers the DNS client to the Root Server, or another Authoritative
            Name Server which is nearest to the required DNS zone. The DNS
            client must then repeat the query directly against the DNS server it
            was referred to.
          </p>
          <h3>Non-Recursive Query</h3>
          <p>
            A non-recursive query is a query in which the DNS Resolver already
            knows the answer. It either immediately returns a DNS record because
            it already stores it in local cache, or queries a DNS Name Server
            which is authoritative for the record, meaning it definitely holds
            the correct IP for that hostname. In both cases, there is no need
            for additional rounds of queries (like in recursive or iterative
            queries). Rather, a response is immediately returned to the client.
          </p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <h2>DNS Types: 3 Types of DNS Servers</h2>
          <p>
            The following are the most common DNS server types that are used to
            resolve hostnames into IP addresses.
          </p>
          <h3>DNS Resolver</h3>
          <p>
            A DNS resolver (recursive resolver), is designed to receive DNS
            queries, which include a human-readable hostname such as
            &ldquo;www.example.com&rdquo;, and is responsible for tracking the
            IP address for that hostname.
          </p>
          <h3>DNS Root Server</h3>
          <p>
            The root server is the first step in the journey from hostname to IP
            address. The DNS Root Server extracts the Top Level Domain (TLD)
            from the user&rsquo;s query &mdash; for example,
            www.example.com&nbsp;&mdash;<strong>&nbsp;</strong>and provides
            details for the&nbsp;<strong>.com</strong>&nbsp;TLD Name Server. In
            turn, that server will provide details for domains with the .com DNS
            zone, including &ldquo;example.com&rdquo;.
          </p>

            Higher level servers in the DNS hierarchy define which DNS server is
            the &ldquo;authoritative&rdquo; name server for a specific hostname,
            meaning that it holds the up-to-date information for that hostname.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Authoritative Name Server is the last stop in the name server
            query&mdash;it takes the hostname and returns the correct IP address
            to the DNS Resolver (or if it cannot find the domain, returns the
            message NXDOMAIN).
          </p>

            DNS Types: 10 Top DNS Record Types
          </h2>
          <p>
            DNS servers create a DNS record to provide important information
            about a domain or hostname, particularly its current IP address. The
            most common DNS record types are:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Address Mapping record (A Record)&mdash;</strong>also
              known as a DNS host record, stores a hostname and its
              corresponding IPv4 address.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>IP Version 6 Address record (AAAA Record)&mdash;</strong
              >stores a hostname and its corresponding IPv6 address.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Canonical Name record (CNAME Record)&mdash;</strong>can be
              used to alias a hostname to another hostname. When a DNS client
              requests a record that contains a CNAME, which points to another
              hostname, the DNS resolution process is repeated with the new
              hostname.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Mail exchanger record (MX Record)&mdash;</strong>specifies
              an SMTP email server for the domain, used to route outgoing emails
              to an email server.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Name Server records (NS Record)&mdash;</strong>specifies
              that a DNS Zone, such as &ldquo;example.com&rdquo; is delegated to
              a specific Authoritative Name Server, and provides the address of
              the name server.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Reverse-lookup Pointer records (PTR Record)&mdash;</strong
              >allows a DNS resolver to provide an IP address and receive a
              hostname (reverse DNS lookup).
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Certificate record (CERT Record)&mdash;</strong>stores
              encryption certificates&mdash;PKIX, SPKI, PGP, and so on.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Service Location (SRV Record)&mdash;</strong>a service
              location record, like MX but for other communication protocols.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Text Record (TXT Record)&mdash;</strong>typically carries
              machine-readable data such as opportunistic encryption, sender
              policy framework, DKIM, DMARC, etc.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Start of Authority (SOA Record)&mdash;</strong>this record
              appears at the beginning of a DNS zone file, and indicates the
              Authoritative Name Server for the current DNS zone, contact
              details for the domain administrator, domain serial number, and
              information on how frequently DNS information for this zone should
              be refreshed
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h2>Dynamic DNS</h2>
          <p>
            <strong>Dynamic DNS</strong> is a DNS service, which provides the
            option to change the IP address of one or multiple DNS records
            automatically when the IP address of your device is changed
            dynamically by the internet provider.<br />
            <br />
            The service is also called DDNS or Dyn DNS in technical jargon.
          </p>
          <p>
            Dynamic DNS, also known as DDNS, solves the problem of ever changing
            residential IP addresses by associating your address with a
            consistent domain name without the need to buy a pricey static IP.
          </p>
          <p>
            Having a home IP address is not as simple as having a business IP
            address. When you become a residential customer of an ISP, they
            provide you with an IP address so you can access the internet from
            your home. However, these dynamic IP addresses frequently change, as
            the ISP manages their own online systems. This makes it difficult to
            utilize your residential IP address with other services (webcam,
            security camera, thermostat, etc.) as the address continues to
            change without notice.Thankfully, Dynamic DNS can help by assigning
            a custom domain name to your home IP address that will update
            automatically as your home IP continues to change.
